## Virtual Pets Amok

In the virtual pet shelter there are Dogs, Cats, Robotic Dogs, and Robotic Cats. The OrganicPet class controls hunger, thirst, and waste values that are modified by feeding, watering, and cleaning the organic pets. Pets in the RoboticPet class cannot be fed, watered, or cleaned. Robotic pets instead have an oil level that can be modified by oiling the robotic pets. Pets in the OrganicPet class cannot be oiled. All robotic and organic pets extend the Pet class which controls values for boredom, health, and happiness. Hunger, thirst, boredom, waste, and oil levels are all updated with each turn the user takes. Health is decreased when hunger, thirst, or waste get too high. Health is also decreased if oil level drops to low. Happiness is increased though playing with pets. Dogs and Robotic Dogs both implement an interface that allows them to be walked reducing waste in Dogs and increasing happiness in both Dogs and Robotic Dogs.

Pets can also be adopted or admitted to the shelter though user input. Constructors for all pet classes are overridden to have default values for hunger, thirst, boredom, waste, oil level, health, and happiness where applicable so the user only needs to enter the pet name, description, and type.
